# PseudoEditoR
An IDE for pseudocode used in our school, written in C# using the WPF. This started as a joke, but was extended after a while until it was actually
usable. It is possible to define custom programming languages by placing JSON files similar to `PseudoEditoR/Resources/languages` into
the installation directory. Keep in mind that the performance exponentially degrades with the number of lines of code.
